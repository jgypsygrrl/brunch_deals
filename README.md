# Brunch Deals App

### GA WDI NYC Jan 14, Project 1

### Overview

**Brunch Deals** is an aggregator that allows you to search brunch deals in your neighborhood.  The app will allow you to purchase the deals, save them, share/invite your friends and send text reminders when the deals will expire.

Brunch Deals uses the [8coupons search API](http://www.8coupons.com/api/doc) to populate the aggregated brunch deals and the [Twilio API](http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages) to send text message reminders.
